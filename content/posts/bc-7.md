<p><br>We attempted to use Fly Machines to run some untrusted Babashka code (<a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/platypub/issues/21">see #21</a>). But the commands I copied and pasted from their docs just returned errors. Hilariously, it turns out that the Fly Machines API <a href="https://status.flyio.net/#past-incidents">was having downtime</a> while we recorded this video (Sep 29).</p>
<p>(So is it worth your time even watching this? Well... up to you, but I already recorded it, so might as well publish!)</p>
