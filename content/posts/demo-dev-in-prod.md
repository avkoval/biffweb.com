<p>In the first ten minutes I cover developing in production with Biff in general (i.e. developing an application while it's running in production instead of developing locally and then deploying). If you're interested in the concept then you could watch just that section. In the rest of the video, I develop some initial features for <a href="https://biffweb.com/p/platypub-plans/">Platypub</a>. The code I wrote can be found in <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/platypub/commit/2443083df97c32577072e5493dd66cc519afee9f">this commit</a>.</p>
