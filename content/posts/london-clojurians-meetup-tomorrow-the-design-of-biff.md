<p>Hey, just a quick reminder that I'll giving a presentation tomorrow at 10:30 AM Pacific/6:30 PM GMT for the London Clojurians meetup titled "The Design of Biff." It'll start out with a standard "what is Biff" overview, then in the second half I'll discuss my thought process/motivations for a few of Biff's features. You can <a href="https://www.meetup.com/London-Clojurians/events/297926307/">RSVP on Meetup</a> to get the link. It'll be a YouTube live event, with a text chat box for comments and questions.</p>
<p>Hope to see you there!</p>
