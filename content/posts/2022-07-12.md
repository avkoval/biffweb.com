<p>There are now recordings available for the first <a href="https://biffweb.com/p/bpp-1/">Biff pair programming session</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m1HbWpWiTk4">Visual-tools meetup</a> (in the latter, my mini presentation on Platypub starts near the end <a href="https://youtu.be/m1HbWpWiTk4?t=3140">at 52:50</a>).</p>
<p>I'm going to start doing these pair programming sessions regularly, on the 1st and 3rd Thursday of each month, at 16:30 UTC (9:30 Pacific). If we don't have anyone scheduled to be the driver, it's very easy for me to just step in and do a streamed solo coding session, so it shouldn't be much of a burden on my end!</p>
<p>Here's <a href="https://calndr.link/event/jcRxgJXIb2">an event page</a> for the next one, on July 21st. Jeff Parker will be driving this time.</p>
<p>Clojurists Together <a href="https://twitter.com/cljtogether/status/1546530679206412290">just announced</a> that applications are open for the next funding round. I'm considering doing an application to fund a "Biff from the ground up" guide. I'd like to write a series of blog posts/tutorials that introduce readers to the web dev libraries used in Biff, one at a time. By the end of it, readers would have a detailed understanding of how Biff works under the hood.</p>
<p>I think it would also be nice to add a section to the Biff website that targets people who are brand new to Clojure (and interested in using it for web dev). Maybe we could curate some resources, e.g. "go here to learn the language fundamentals," "go here to learn how to set up your editor," etc. And then of course, "check out Biff/this new blog series when you're ready to start building some web apps."</p>
<p>Anyway, just a thought. We'll see what happens!</p>
<p>In other news, I have just published <a href="https://blog.thesample.ai/p/dumb/">I can't believe I'm about to build another dumb web app</a> to my Tools for Online Speech newsletter. I've decided at long last to do yet another pivot with my startup. However I'm time boxing this one to 3 months. All the applications I mention in that post are or will be built with Biff, of course.</p>
