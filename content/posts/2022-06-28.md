<p>(Quick non-meetup-related announcement: I'm available for freelancing/consulting. Leads appreciated. I wrote <a href="https://clojurians.slack.com/archives/C013Y4VG20J/p1656451188628979">a few more details</a> on Clojurians Slack.)</p>
<p>First, I've been invited to give a quick presentation on Platypub at the upcoming visual tools meetup this Saturday at 16:00 UTC. <a href="https://clojureverse.org/t/visual-tools-meeting-9-general-monthly-meeting/9040">Event details</a>. <a href="https://bit.ly/visual-tools-1-zoom">Zoom link</a>.</p>

<p>Second, Jeremy Taylor and I will be doing a pair programming session over Zoom to work on some open Platypub issues. It'll be a week from Thursday at 16:30 UTC. <a href="https://calndr.link/event/ewBn9k1oWq">Event details</a>. <a href="https://us05web.zoom.us/j/83801925742?pwd=RkR4UThWUWZRelhTOW1iVXdTcUVFZz09">Zoom link</a>. Let me know if you'd like to do a future pairing session with me!</p>

<p>This is the first of hopefully multiple Biff Pair Programming Sessions&reg;, in which we work on some issues from a Biff project and then chat or whatever. It'll be pretty relaxed; a great way to make sure you're getting enough screen time, and learn each other some Clojure web dev while we're at it.<br><br>This time, Jeremy Taylor will be driving! (Please clap.) We'll work on some Platypub issues (<a class="link" href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/platypub" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://github.com/jacobobryant/platypub</a>). July 7th @ 16:30 UTC.<br><br>Join Zoom Meeting<br><a class="link" href="https://us05web.zoom.us/j/83801925742?pwd=RkR4UThWUWZRelhTOW1iVXdTcUVFZz09" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://us05web.zoom.us/j/83801925742?pwd=RkR4UThWUWZRelhTOW1iVXdTcUVFZz09</a></p>
