<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff/releases/tag/v0.7.11">v0.7.11</a> and <a href="https://github.com/jacobobryant/biff/releases/tag/v0.7.15">v0.7.15</a> have been released, containing various tweaks and bug fixes.</li>
<li>I published <a href="https://biffweb.com/p/understanding-htmx/">Understanding htmx</a>, an explanation of how I think about htmx conceptually. Includes some advice on deciding if htmx is a good fit for your project.</li>
<li>Also just barely published <a href="https://biffweb.com/p/xtdb-compared-to-other-databases/">XTDB compared to other databases</a>, which gives some background on why I went with XTDB for Biff instead of Postgres or Datomic.</li>
</ul>
<p>Both of these essays are part of my latest grant from <a href="https://www.clojuriststogether.org/">Clojurists Together</a>.&nbsp;Also as part of that, I'll be publishing one more essay and a few how-to guides:</p>
<ul>
<li>Philosophy of Biff &mdash; I have <a href="https://forum.tfos.co/t/draft-philosophy-of-biff">a draft</a> of this complete already; I'll publish after it marinates for a bit.</li>
<li>How to replace XTDB with Postgres or Datomic (I wanted to get the rationale essay above finished before I did this one!)</li>
<li>How to deploy Biff on containers instead of a VM. I've experimented a bit with <a href="https://fly.io/">Fly</a> already, but it still feels a bit early in some aspects. For this guide I think I'll stick with DigitalOcean, either with their <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform">Heroku alternative</a> or maybe even with their managed Kubernetes offering (Biff Enterprise&reg;!). Either way there'll be a Dockerfile you can use.</li>
<li>How to replace htmx with re-frame &mdash; for those who need a little more pizzazz.</li>
</ul>

<p>From the forum:</p>

<li><a href="https://forum.tfos.co/t/maybe-platypub-should-be-a-desktop-app">Maybe Platypub should be a desktop app</a>. I know I've been saying this for a year+ already, but I'm really hoping to do some more work on Platypub soon.</li>
<li><a href="https://forum.tfos.co/t/a-micro-fund-for-biff-tfos-projects">A micro fund for Biff projects</a>, and my <a href="https://forum.tfos.co/t/a-micro-fund-for-biff-tfos-projects/94/4?u=jacobobryant">latest thoughts</a> on the subject. Feels like kind of a crazy idea, but maybe would be interesting to try for a little while.</li>
</ul>
<p>Happy Halloween to all who celebrate.<br>Jacob</p>
