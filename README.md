Content + source code for [biffweb.com](https://biffweb.com). Documentation is under `content/docs/`. Feel free to
submit PRs for corrections.

Made with [Platypub](https://github.com/jacobobryant/platypub/tree/lite). You can run the site locally with `clj -M:run
watch`, but it requires some setup that I haven't documented yet.
